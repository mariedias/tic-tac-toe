# Tic Tac Toe
This is a customizable Tic Tac Toe game with a variable board size. <br>
Players can select the board's dimensions (e.g., 3x3, 4x4) and compete against each other.

I developed this project using the Eclipse IDE, and it serves as a practical demonstration of fundamental Java programming concepts.<br>
